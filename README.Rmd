## Installation

You can install the released version of `MetaNet` from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("MetaNet")
```

You can install the development version of `MetaNet` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Asa12138/MetaNet")
```

## Workflow overview

<img src="man/figures/fig1.jpeg"  width="500" />

**Figure 1. Overview of the MetaNet workflow and its high-efficiency computation.**
(A) Functional modules of MetaNet, visualized using MetaNet itself.
(B) Detailed workflow of MetaNet. Green boxes indicate data objects, red boxes represent MetaNet-specific objects, and gray boxes denote core functions.
(C) MetaNet logo and its available code repositories and platforms.
(D) Line plots comparing memory usage and runtime for correlation-based network construction across different R packages. Error bars represent standard deviation (SD).
(E) Line plots showing MetaNetâ€™s performance on increasingly larger datasets in terms of memory usage and runtime. Error bars represent SD.

**Figure 2. MetaNet supports flexible and intuitive network manipulation.**
(A) Initial multi-omics network constructed without annotations.
(B) Annotated multi-omics network using the "c_net_set" function. Node shape indicates omics type, color represents omics subtypes, size denotes average abundance, edge color indicates positive or negative correlation, edge type distinguishes intra- and inter-omics connections, and edge width reflects the absolute value of the correlation coefficient.
(C) Subnetwork filtered from intra-omics interactions between the Microbiome and Metabolome layers using "c_net_filter".
(D) Highlighted nodes centered on "s__Dongia_mobilis" and its neighbors using "c_net_highlight".
(E) Community detection and modular visualization using "c_net_module".
(F) Chord diagram displaying the proportion of edges between modules.
(G) Skeleton network across omics subtypes at a grouped level using "c_net_skeleton".
(H) Operations among networks: "c_net_union" merges net1 and net2, "c_net_intersect" extracts shared nodes and edges, and "c_net_difference" isolates net1-specific nodes and edges. All networks shown are based on simulated data and are for illustrative purposes only.

**Figure 3. MetaNet enables diverse and powerful network layout strategies.**
(A) Application of 24 out of more than 40 built-in layout algorithms from "c_net_layout" on the Zachary Karate Club network.
(B) Layout generated within a star using "spatstat_layout".
(C) Layout applied within the map of Australia using "spatstat_layout".
(D) Grouped network layout consisting of four subgroups arranged with "with_fr()", "on_grid()", "as_polycircle(3)", and "as_polygon(3)" within a human-body schematic. All visualization elements were rendered entirely in MetaNet without manual adjustment.
(E) Modular network visualized using "g_layout_circlepack".
(F) Three-layer modular structure visualized using "g_layout_multi_layer". All networks shown are based on simulated data and carry no biological interpretation.
